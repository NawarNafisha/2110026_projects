This project is a continuation of my previous Travel and Tour Management Website, expanding it with full backend functionality and an integrated admin panel, Developed under the Software Development Project 2 (ECE 3100) course.
The frontend interface continues to be designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as incorporates dynamic data handling using XAMPP and CodeIgniter as the backend framework.
