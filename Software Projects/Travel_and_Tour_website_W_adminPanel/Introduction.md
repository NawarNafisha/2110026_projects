This project is a continuation of my previous Travel and Tour Management Website, expanding it with full backend functionality and an integrated admin panel. It was developed under the Software Development Project 2 (ECE 3100) course.
The frontend interface continues to be designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend was built using PHP, along with XAMPP and CodeIgniter for dynamic data handling and server-side operations.
