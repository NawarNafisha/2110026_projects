This project presents a responsive Travel and Tour Management Website developed as part of the Software Development Project 1 course (ECE-2100). The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate and apply my foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by designing an interactive, user-friendly responsive frontend interface.
